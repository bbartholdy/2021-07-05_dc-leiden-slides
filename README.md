This repository contains the slides used on Day 4 of the Data Carpentry for Social Sciences [workshop](https://leidenuniversitylibrary.github.io/2021-10-25-lde-online/) hosted by TU Delft, Leiden University, and Erasmus University Rotterdam.

These slides cover the data visualisation part of the workshop only.
They were based on slides created by [Bjorn Bartholdy](https://github.com/bbartholdy) and contain exercises (and solutions) created by The Carpentries for the [*Data Visualisation with ggplot2*](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/04-ggplot2/index.html) episode of the [*R for Social Scientists*](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) lesson.
