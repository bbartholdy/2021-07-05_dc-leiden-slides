## Why ggplot2?

...because these are 'base' plots

.pull-left[
```{r base-pl-1}
plot(number_items ~ no_membrs, 
     interviews_plotting, 
     col = "blue")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r base-pl-2}
boxplot(rooms ~ village, 
        interviews_plotting, 
        col = c("blue", "green", "red"))
```
]

---
class: center, middle

...and these are ggplots `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`

.pull-left[
```{r ggplot-1}
interviews_plotting %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items, color = village)) +
      geom_count() +
      theme_bw() +
      labs(x = "Number of items", 
           y = "Number of members in a household")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ggplot-2}
interviews_plotting %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = village, y = rooms, fill = village)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())

## ggplot2

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/master/pkgdown/favicon/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png)

[**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a package (included in **tidyverse**) for creating highly customisable plots that are built
step-by-step by adding layers.

The separation of a plot into layers allows a high degree of flexibility with
minimal effort.

## Data Visualisation Exercises

class: center, middle

## Exercise 1

`r emo::ji("clock")` **10 mins**

Create a scatter plot of `rooms` by `village` with the `respondant_wall_type`
showing in different colours. 

Does this seem like a good way to display the relationship between these variables?

What other kinds of plots might you use to show this type of data?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

---
class: center, middle, inverse

## Exercise 1: Solution

```{r exercise-1-sol, fig.width=9, fig.height=3.5, fig.retina=3}
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = rooms)) +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = respondent_wall_type),
		    alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2, height = 0.2)
```

It is difficult to distinguish between villages and see patterns, right?

Suggestions to improve this?

## Exercise 2

`r emo::ji("clock")` **5 mins**

Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. For example,
if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a boxplot.

Replace the box plot with a violin plot  
see `geom_violin()`

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

---
class: center, middle, inverse

## Exercise 2: Solution

```{r exercise-2-sol, fig.width=9, fig.height=3.5, fig.retina=3}
interviews_plotting %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = rooms)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = "tomato")
```

## Exercise 3

`r emo::ji("clock")` **10 mins**

Create a bar plot showing the proportion of respondents in each village who are 
or are not part of an irrigation association (`memb_assoc`). 

Include only respondents who answered that question in the calculations and plot.

Which village had the lowest proportion of respondents in an irrigation association?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

### Hint

```{r exercise-3-hint}
percent_memb_assoc <- interviews_plotting %>%
  filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
  count(village, memb_assoc) %>%
  group_by(village) %>%
  mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()
```

---

## Exercise 3: Solution

```{r exercise-3-sol, fig.width=7, fig.height=2.5, fig.retina=3}
percent_memb_assoc <- interviews_plotting %>%
  filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
  count(village, memb_assoc) %>%
  group_by(village) %>%
  mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()

percent_memb_assoc %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = memb_assoc)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```

## Exercise 4

`r emo::ji("clock")` **5 mins**

Experiment with at least two different themes. Build the previous plot using each
of those themes. 

Which do you like best?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

--

### Hint

.pull-left[
`theme_minimal`  
`theme_void`  
`theme_classic`  
]
.pull-right[
`theme_dark`  
`theme_grey`  
`theme_light`
]

## Exercise 4: Solution

```{r exercise-4-sol, eval=FALSE}
percent_items %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    facet_wrap(~ items) +
    theme_bw() + #<<
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

## R Markdown

class: center, middle

## Why R Markdown?

R Markdown allows you to seamlessly combine executable R code, its output, 
and text in a single document. 

These documents can be readily converted to multiple static and dynamic output
formats, including PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), and HTML (.html).

The benefit of a well-prepared R Markdown document is full reproducibility.

</a>

---
class: center, middle

## Why R Markdown?

Full reproducibility also means that, if you notice a data transcription error, 
or you are able to add more data to your analysis, you will be able to recompile
the report without making any changes in the actual document.

## R Markdown Exercises

## Exercise 5

`r emo::ji("clock")` **5 mins**

Play around with the different options in the chunk with the code for the table,
and re-Knit to see what each option does to the output.

What happens if you use `eval=FALSE` and `echo=FALSE`? 

What is the difference between this and `include=FALSE`?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

---
class: center, middle, inverse

## Exercise 5: Solution

Create a chunk with `eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE`

then create another chunk with `include=FALSE` to compare. 

`eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE` will neither run the code in the chunk, nor show the
code in the knitted document. The code chunk essentially doesnâ€™t exist in the
knitted document...

...whereas `include=FALSE` will run the code and store the output for later use.

class: center, middle

## Exercise 6

`r emo::ji("clock")` **10 mins**

Create a new code chunk for the plot, and copy the code from any of the plots we
created in the previous episode to produce a plot in the chunk,  
and use your
newly acquired customisation skills to make it look really nice!

If you are feeling adventurous, you can also create a new plot with the
`interviews_plotting` data frame.

## Exercise 6: Solution

```{r exercise-6-setup, echo=FALSE}
percent_wall_type <- interviews_plotting %>%
    filter(respondent_wall_type != "cement") %>%
    count(village, respondent_wall_type) %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
    ungroup()
```


```{r exercise-6-sol, fig.width=9, fig.height=3.5, fig.retina=3}
percent_wall_type %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    theme_classic() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() # add colourblind-friendly palette
```
